		For Those Who are Just Getting Into the Scene
	</h2>
	<img src="Images/rsz_1getting_started.jpg">
	<p>For those who are just getting into the scene, please remember that cycling is NOT for everyone. It takes a special, superior, type of person to really appreciate all of the wonderful joys of cycling. And if you go into it just to find that it's not really for you, you should feel bad, because it means that you're just a failure at life. But seriously, when <i>I</i> first started, I wasn't all that into it, but with a little bit of determination, I was finally able to realize that only <strong>losers</strong> hate cycling. So, I <strong>forced</strong> myself to love it, and you should too! I mean, just think of all the benefits! Stronger legs, more bike expenses, a loving community! When you get into the cycling life you're there forever! Just don't be <i>here</i> too long though, our servers might overload.</p>

		Finding Your Bike
	</h2>
	<img src="Images/Finding_Bike.jpg">
	<p>When shopping for a bike, you're going to come across bikes of all shapes and sizes. Most notably, you'll have to make the decision between buying a road, mountain, cruiser, or hybrid bike. Basically, the road bike is for those speedsters out there. Designed for asphalt, the road bike is the lightest and fastest out of all the others. It's what racers use. The main disadvantage is that it's not good for any off-road driving. The mountain bike on the other hand, is purely designed for off-road driving, and is the slowest and heaviest of them all. The cruiser is what I call the hipter bike. It's heavy and inefficient and is only ridden by posers. Lastly, the hybrid bike is a combination of the mountain and road bike types and it's what I personally use as it is ideal for the city. In fact, all of those Citibikes fall into the category of hybrid.</p>
