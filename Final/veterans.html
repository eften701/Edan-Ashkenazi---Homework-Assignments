	<p>On the first Sunday in May, 32,000 cyclists of all skill levels come from around the world to roll through every borough of New York City on streets totally free of cars. For one day, the roads are yours, the bridges are yours, the City is yours - there's no better way to experience the Big Apple. Produced in conjunction with the City of New York, the TD Five Boro Bike Tour Presented by REI is the largest charitable bike ride in the U.S., with proceeds funding our free bike education programs. Last year alone, we taught more than 17,000 kids and adults. When you ride with Bike New York, you're helping us in our mission to empower more New Yorkers with the skills to ride safely and confidently on city streets.</p>

			Bronzini: I'm going to retire when I feel like it

	<p>On Friday, Bronzini finished the race over 8 minutes behind the leaders. When asked about her ambitions the two-time road race world champion admitted she was more focused on the flat sprint stages, and letting her teammates take opportunistic chances.</p>

	<p>"Ah well, survive in the first two stages, and we'll see in stage 3 and 4 if we can get some result," Bronzini said. "We are not a big team here, so we do not have a lot of expectations against full teams on board. We are going to figure it out ourselves if the girls riding with me have the possibility to show themselves in the race. It is important to give to the mates a way to try and have the best chance for themselves."</p>
